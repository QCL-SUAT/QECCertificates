# A kernel checker for LRAT certificates, with its soundness theorem

An external SAT solver only **produces evidence**, and the evidence is then re-checked
**inside the kernel**. This is how this library implements the red line that the output
of an external solver does not enter the trusted base. The module turns that
into a theorem rather than relying on "the checker said OK":

* `rupCheck db C hints`: whether the clause `C` is RUP with respect to the database `db`,
  by negating `C` and deriving a conflict by unit propagation along `hints`;
* `checkSteps db steps`: the step-by-step LRAT check, where clause numbers must be
  consecutive, each clause must be RUP, and deriving the empty clause means success;
* **`rupAux_sound` / `checkSteps_sound` / `unsat_of_checkSteps`**: a successful check
  implies that the CNF is **unsatisfiable**. The `#print axioms` of the three is exactly
  the three standard axioms: **no solver, no `native_decide`, no custom axiom**.

The data, real CNFs together with their LRAT certificates, lives in
`Reflect/LRATData.lean` and is translated byte for byte by an external generator from the
output of an external encoder and solver.

## Why the soundness theorem is the point

"Some certificate passed the checker I wrote" is a statement about a **program**; "this
CNF is unsatisfiable" is a statement about **mathematics**. Turning the former into the
latter is exactly what `checkSteps_sound` does, and in doing so it promotes the
certificate from **solver output** to a **kernel theorem**, while the checker itself,
about two hundred lines, enters the trusted base along with it.

## Representation

A literal is a `Nat × Bool`, a variable number that is 0-based together with a polarity,
and a partial assignment is a **list of literals already set true**, so that unit
propagation is list appending and "propagation reaches a conflict" is "the literals of
some hint clause are all false". Everything is a computation the kernel can reduce.

**The clause database is an interface, not an `Array`.** `ClauseDB` requires only four
operations, namely lookup, length, append and build, and three laws, and the laws keep
**only the half that soundness actually consumes**: `checkAux_sound` needs "after an
append, every clause in the database is either the new one or was already there", and the
converse direction is never used, so it is not stated. That missing half is exactly where
a balanced-tree instance would need the hard invariant "key < index". `ClauseDB.array` is
the **verbatim** instance from before the interface was opened, so downstream users are
unaffected.

**Why the interface is opened up** (measured in this library). Inside the **kernel**,
`Array`'s `push` and `get?` are both **linear in the index**, so each step of `rupCheck`
costs more than the last and the whole certificate is **quadratic** in the number of
steps, whereas a balanced tree is logarithmic. Measured in reduction steps for
$N = 200 \to 400$: `Array` 40,803 to 161,603 (3.96×) and `Std.TreeMap` 4,757 to 11,066
(2.33×, against a theoretical 2.26×). Extrapolated to the 570,883 steps of the replay,
the two differ by about a factor of 9,400.

**A second instance is in place.** `ClauseDB.tree` uses `Std.TreeMap`, with key = clause
number minus one and `push` appending at `size`, so each lookup and insertion is
$O(\log n)$ in the kernel. It returns the same verdict as `array` on the same real
certificate: `checkStepsWith ClauseDB.tree rep7CNF rep7Proof = true` is closed by
`decide`. At the 36-step level its reduction count is already about half of `array`, 13k
against 28.6k, and extrapolated to 570,883 steps the two differ by about a factor of
9,400.

**One standard-library trap is worth recording**: for the empty tree, the lemma
`Const.get? ∅ i = none` is `@[simp]`, yet `∅.inner` and the `∅` in the lemma **do not
match syntactically**, so neither `rw` nor `simp only` with that lemma fires. Only a bare
`simp`, which matches up to definitional equality, works.

/-! ## 2. The clause database interface

Kernel replay uses only **four operations** of the database, namely lookup, length,
append and build, and **three laws**. Changing the representation, from `Array` to a
balanced tree, is therefore an **instantiation**, not a re-proof of a load-bearing
module.

**Why the interface is opened up** (measured in this library). Inside the **kernel**,
`Array`'s `push` and `get?` are both **linear in the index**, so each step of `rupCheck`
costs more than the last and the whole certificate is quadratic in the number of steps,
whereas a balanced tree is logarithmic. Measured in **reduction steps**, which are
deterministic and free of start-up noise, for $N = 200 \to 400$: `Array` 40,803 to
161,603 (3.96×) and `Std.TreeMap` 4,757 to 11,066 (2.33×, against a theoretical 2.26×).
Extrapolated to the 570,883 steps of the replay, the two differ by about a factor of
