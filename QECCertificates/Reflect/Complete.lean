# Encoding faithfulness: the completeness direction

`Reflect/Encode.lean` provides **soundness**: every clause satisfied $\\Longrightarrow$ the
semantic condition holds. Is that enough to turn "the solver reports unsatisfiable" into
"there is no light logical operator"? No. What is missing is the converse direction:
**the encoding does not over-constrain**, so that whenever the semantic condition holds
there **exists** an assignment of the auxiliary variables under which all clauses are true.
Only the two together give "satisfiable if and only if a light logical operator exists", and
"a UNSAT verdict implies a distance lower bound" is exactly the forward direction of that
equivalence.

This module supplies the converse direction. Each of the four components comes with a
**constructive** lemma:

| component | construction |
|---|---|
| `xorChain` | the auxiliary variables take the **prefix parity**: at counter `c + i` the value is `acc ⊕ σ x₀ ⊕ ⋯ ⊕ σ xᵢ` |
| `prodClauses` | the product variables take `σ x ∧ σ w` |
| `atMostK` | slot `(i,j)` takes "at least `j` of the first `i` variables are true" |
| `buildPair` | the four segments are concatenated, see `buildPair_complete` |

## Why the construction is written segment by segment rather than as a single function

The encoder allocates the auxiliary variable numbers **sequentially** (`c1Of`/`c2Of`/`c3Of`
are determined by the exit point of the preceding segment), so building the assignment
segment by segment matches that order and avoids counting arithmetic of the form
`c1Of = 2n + Σ(|r| - 1)`. The interface for the concatenation is the pair of properties of
`chainAssign`: **below the counter it agrees with the input**, and **above the counter it
reads only the current segment**, so the assignment of a later segment leaves the ground of
an earlier one untouched.

## What "light logical operator" means in this module

Here a light logical operator is still only a **semantic condition** (a weight bound,
kernels on the two sides, and a pairing equal to 1); the step that turns it into a statement
about codes is spelled out in the module documentation of `Reflect/Encode.lean`, and both
sides use the same set of conditions, so composing the equivalence needs no further
translation between them.

/-! ## 1. Completeness of the Tseitin chain -/

/-- The fill value of a chain: `rest` allocates the auxiliary variables starting from the
counter `c`, and `acc` is **the value of the accumulator on entering this segment**.

At `t = c` the value is `acc ⊕ σ x₀`, and at `t = c + i` it is
`acc ⊕ σ x₀ ⊕ ⋯ ⊕ σ xⱼ` (where `j` is the `i`-th element); outside the allocated range it is
`false` (those variable numbers should never be referenced anyway).

Note that it **does not read `σ` at `t < c`**, which is the source of "a later segment does
not overwrite an earlier one" during concatenation. -/

/-! ## 2. Concatenation: one chain per row

`chainsFrom` turns each row into a chain and allocates the variable numbers end to end.
Completeness has to **concatenate segment by segment**: the assignment of a later segment
must leave the ground of an earlier one untouched, and the interface is the "agrees with the
input below the counter" property of `chainAssign`.

Two bookkeeping lemmas are needed for this: the **exit counter** of a chain (the new
variable numbers reach exactly `c + rest.length`) and the **variable bound** of the chain
clauses (all of them lie below the exit counter). -/

/-! ## 4. Completeness of the sequential counter (Sinz)

The soundness of `atMostK` is "all clauses true implies at most `k` variables are true"
(`Reflect/Encode.lean`). The converse direction assigns **slot `(i,j)` to "at least `j` of
the first `i` variables are true"** and verifies the four clauses row by row.

Three preliminaries are needed: the recursion for `slotBase` (the block before row `i+1` has
`min i (k+1)` slots more than the block before row `i`, namely those of row `i`), a
characterization of the value of `slotVar`, and a few lemmas that bridge the clause

The scrutinee of the `match` in `slotClauses` consists of three `Option` values. A `rw` on
the slot in the goal does not move it, because the slot is a **function argument**; the
three values are therefore first written as hypotheses, and the `match` then reduces. -/

/-! ### Completeness of one row

Row `i` processes the `i`-th variable, and the value of slot `(i,j)` is determined by
"at least `j` of the first `i` variables are true". Here `cnt'` is the number of true values
among the first `i-1` variables, `cnt` that among the first `i`, and `bx` the value of the
`i`-th variable; `hprev`/`hcur` state the slot values of the previous row and of this row as
hypotheses, so this lemma only performs the verification at the level of `Bool`.

The four cases are separated by whether the slots `(i-1,j)` and `(i-1,j-1)` of the previous
row are valid, which is the branch condition of the `match` in `slotClauses`. -/

/-! ### Filling row by row, and the main theorem

Write the slot block of row `i` into the assignment. **The block boundaries are pinned down
by `slotBase`**: row `i` occupies `[c + slotBase k i, c + slotBase k (i+1))`, and
`slotBase k (i+1) = slotBase k i + min i (k+1)` (`slotBase_succ`) says that the two blocks
meet end to end without overlapping. In the induction, "later rows leave the slots already
filled by earlier rows alone" is exactly this, and it chains the segment-by-segment
construction together **without** having to recover the row index from a variable number. -/

earlier rows are not overwritten by later ones), and it **characterizes the slot values of

/-! ## 5. Assembly: completeness of `buildPair`

The assignments of the four segments are concatenated segment by segment. The assembly has
to move "the clauses of a segment are satisfied by that segment's assignment" to the
**final** assignment, and it rests on two facts: **the counters only increase** (the
threshold of a later segment is never lower than that of an earlier one), and **the
variables of each segment's clauses lie below its own exit counter**.

The segments and counters of `buildPair` (`Reflect/Encode.lean`): the kernel constraints
start at `2n`, the pairing constraints at `c1Of`, the product block at `c2Of`, the chain for
`x·w` at `c2Of + n`, and the counter at `c3Of`. -/
