# A checkable certificate for the distance lower bound: handing "no lighter logical operator" to the kernel

`GF2/Witness` provides the **two-sided interface** that pins down the distance, but the
lower-bound side still sits at the abstract form "given a per-operator inequality", which
is the part LeanQEC delegates to a SAT solver. This module lands it:

```
is the set of light operators nonempty?
  = over the candidate vectors of "weight ≤ d-1", filter by
    "nonzero ∧ in the kernel ∧ not in the row space" and see whether anything is left
```

Every piece of the predicate is computable (`inKerB` / `inSpanB` from `GF2/Membership`),
and the candidate set is the **weight-bounded enumeration** of `GF2/WeightEnum`: 121
vectors rather than 32768 at $n = 15$. The whole decision is therefore a **closed Boolean
identity** that `by decide` can settle directly, with the kernel doing the computation.
No SAT solver, no `native_decide`, and no custom axiom is needed.

## The two properties of the candidate set (they decide the soundness and the cost of the certificate)

* **Coverage** (`mem_lightVecs`): every vector of weight $\le w$ lies in the candidate
  set, so "absent from the candidates" means "does not exist at all". This is the source
  of **soundness**, and it is exactly what `Finset.univ` provides for free.
* **Count** (`length_lightVecs`): the candidate set has exactly
  $\sum_{k\le w}\binom nk$ elements. This is the **cost of the certificate**: for
  fixed $d$ it is a polynomial of degree $d-1$ in $n$, not $2^n$.

## Main results

* `lightSet_card_zero_iff`: `(lightSet M₁ M₂ d).card = 0` is **literally equivalent** to
  the lower-bound statement.
* `le_minWeight_of_lightSet_card_zero`: the **lower-bound certificate**; an empty set
  gives the code distance lower bound `d`.
* `eq_minWeight_of_decide`: the **checkable certificate form of the exact distance**,
  with the lower bound by `decide` and an explicit witness for the upper bound; the two
  sides pinch to "the code distance is exactly $d$".
* `lightCand_length_le`: the **certificate complexity**, the candidate space being at
  most $\sum_{k<d}\binom nk$.

/-! ## The set of light operators -/

/-- The predicate "undetectable nontrivial operator of weight less than `d`".

The three pieces together are exactly what the lower bound has to rule out: nonzero,
commuting with every check, yet not an element of the check row space. Each piece is
computable, so the kernel can reduce the whole predicate; the weight bound is carried by
the candidate set itself, `lightVecs n (d-1)`.

Marked `abbrev` rather than `def`: `def` is semireducible, so the instance search for
`DecidablePred` does not unfold it and `Finset.filter` fails to synthesize a decidable
predicate. -/

/-- **The candidate set for the lower-bound certificate**: among the vectors of weight
$\le d-1$, those that commute with the checks yet do not lie in the row space.

The candidates come from `lightVecs n (d-1)`, a **weight-bounded enumeration** rather
than the full space; the $2^n$ version over `Finset.univ` already takes three minutes at
$n = 15$. The bound $d-1$ on the weight is justified because the lower bound only has to
rule out operators of weight $< d$ (`wtRec_eq_hammingNorm` + `Nat.lt_iff_le_pred`). -/

/-! ## The lower-bound certificate -/

/-- **The lower-bound certificate, checkable form**: an empty set of light operators
implies that the code distance is at least `d`.

The proof is contraposition, coverage and translation. If an undetectable operator of
weight below `d` existed, its weight would be nonzero, since otherwise it would lie in
the row space and contradict undetectability, and a weight $\le d-1$ places it in the
weight-bounded enumeration (`mem_lightVecs`; **the soundness of this certificate rests
entirely on that coverage theorem**). The lemmas `inKerB_iff` and `inSpanB_eq_false_iff`
then translate it into the two certificates of the decision layer, and `mem_lightCand`
puts it back into the set, contradicting emptiness. -/

/-! ## The List-form lower-bound entry point (for large candidate sets)

`lightSet` is the `Finset` form of the candidate list, and the deduplication inside
`List.toFinset` compares elements pairwise, at cost $O(N^2)$. On instances such as
$n=24,\ d=4$, with 2325 candidates each a 24-bit vector, **the deduplication itself
dominates the whole `decide`**. The three results below have the same mathematical content
as the `lightSet` family above, with the hypothesis replaced by `lightCand M₁ M₂ d = []`,
so that no part of the `Finset` path enters the reduction.
Small instances ($n\le18$) go through either way; once the candidate count reaches the
thousands, the List form is an order of magnitude apart.

four things have to be supplied: (i) two parity-check matrices, (ii) an explicit low-weight
logical operator `E`, (iii) three closed assertions the kernel can compute, namely that
`E` is in the kernel, that `E` is not in the row space, and that `hammingNorm E = d`, and
(iv) an empty `lightSet`. **No step refers to an external solver or to a custom axiom.** -/

/-- **The size of the candidate space for the lower-bound certificate**: at most
$\sum_{k<d}\binom nk$.

This is the visible content of the certificate-complexity statement for the distance
decision: the candidate set is a weight-bounded enumeration, not $2^n$, and the
**enumeration length is exactly given by binomial coefficients** (`length_lightVecs`). For
fixed $d$ this is a polynomial of degree $d-1$ in $n$: 121 candidates at $n = 15, d = 3$,
against $32768$ for the full space. -/

/-- **The dual witness route**: `w ∈ ker H` together with `w ⬝ᵥ E = 1` implies
`E ∉ rowSpace H`.

An order of magnitude cheaper than `not_mem_rowSpace_of_inSpanB_false`: both assertions are
row-by-row pairings and **row reduction is not needed**. For wide matrices, say the toric
code at $n = 18$, this is not an optimization but the difference between usable and
unusable, since `inSpanB` runs `rowReduce` internally and the kernel reduction cost of
`rowReduce` on an 18-wide matrix would exhaust the heartbeat budget of `by decide`. -/

**Note**: this lemma runs `rowReduce` internally and is expensive on wide matrices; for
those, use `not_mem_rowSpace_of_dualCheck`, the dual witness route, instead. -/
