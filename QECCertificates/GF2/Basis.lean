# Basis-vector sums: the two reduction lemmas

Check matrices are assembled from literals in two ways. Sometimes a row is written as a
`Matrix` and read entry by entry; sometimes, when every row touches a fixed number of block
columns, it is written as the GF(2) **sum of basis vectors** `e a` over its support, and
the whole file's comparisons collapse to a handful of terms. This module holds the four
lemmas the second style rests on. They are generic in `n` and mention no code.

## Main results

* `e_dotProduct`: a basis vector pairs with `v` to the component of `v` at that position.
* `dotProduct_e_sum`: pairing a sum of basis vectors with `v` reads the components of `v`
  on that support — a check-row comparison costs `|A|` terms, not `n`.
* `sum_e_apply`: evaluating a basis-vector sum on a **duplicate-free** support is `1`
  exactly on the support.
* `dot_map_e`: pairing two basis-vector sums gives the parity of the intersection of the
  two supports.

## Where the duplicate-free hypothesis comes from

The three lemmas that mention `Nodup` are stated that way on purpose: without it a repeated
basis vector cancels, and the coordinate formula `if a ∈ l then 1 else 0` would be wrong.
Every call site here builds supports from a `List` that is proved duplicate-free once
(`..._nodup`), so the hypothesis is discharged at the point where the code's data enters,
not at each use. -/
