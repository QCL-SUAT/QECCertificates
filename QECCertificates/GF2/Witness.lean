# Dual-witness certificates and the exact-distance pair of theorems

Certifying a code distance is two-sided. The **lower bound** says that no lighter logical
operator exists, which calls for enumeration or reduction over low-weight operators; the
**upper bound** says that here is one, which needs only a concrete artefact. This module
turns the upper-bound side into an **independently checkable certificate** and joins it
with the LeanQEC distance definition into a closed assertion that the distance is exactly
$d$.

## Dual witnesses

To prove that an operator `E` is **not** in the parity-check row space one need not
enumerate: it suffices to exhibit a vector `w` that commutes with every check and
anticommutes with `E`, that is

  `w ∈ ker H` and `w ⬝ᵥ E = 1`.

This is a certificate-shaped wrapper around LeanQEC's
`not_mem_rowspace_iff_exists_mem_ker`: **the certificate has two entries and each is
checkable on its own**, and completeness (`E ∉ rowSpace` implies such a `w` exists) is
given by that theorem.

## The two-matrix form

The table below (`M₁` supplies the kernel and `M₂` the row space) covers all three classes
of code in this package:

| Code class | `M₁` | `M₂` | weight = |
|---|---|---|---|
| classical linear code | the parity-check matrix `H` | the empty matrix | weight of a nonzero codeword |
| CSS code | one side's checks | the other side's checks | weight of an X-type or Z-type logical operator |
| general stabilizer code | the **symplectic transpose** of the generators | the generators themselves | Pauli weight (the two halves together) |

The last class works because the symplectic inner product is `⟨g, v⟩ = (J g) ⬝ᵥ v` (the
matrix `J` swaps the `Z` half with the `X` half), so commuting with all generators is the
same as lying in the row orthogonal complement of `J`, that is, in `ker J`.

## Main results

* `DualWitness`: the dual-witness certificate structure, with
  `DualWitness.not_mem_rowSpace` as the conclusion the kernel checks.
* `exists_dualWitness_iff`: **the certificate is complete**: `E ∉ rowSpace` is equivalent
  to the existence of a dual witness.
* `minWeight_le_of_witness`: **the upper-bound theorem**: one concrete artefact gives an
  upper bound on the code distance.
* `le_minWeight_of_lower`: **the lower-bound theorem**: a per-operator lower bound gives a
  lower bound on the code distance.
* `eq_minWeight_of_bounds`: **the exact distance**: the two sides together give a distance
  exactly equal to $d$.

/-! ## Dual witnesses -/

/-- **Dual witness**: orthogonal to (commuting with) every row of the parity-check matrix
`H`, while pairing to 1 with `E`.

Two entries, each checkable on its own: the first says that it commutes with every check
and the second that it anticommutes with `E`. Together they prove that `E` is not an
element of the stabilizer group, which is the smallest certificate for the judgement that
`E` is a logical operator. -/

/-- **Certificate soundness**: holding a dual witness proves that `E` is not in the
parity-check row space, hence that it is a logical operator. -/

/-- **Certificate completeness**: `E` is not in the row space if and only if a dual
witness exists.

Completeness is LeanQEC's `not_mem_rowspace_iff_exists_mem_ker`; this package wraps its
existential output in the shape of a checkable certificate. -/

/-! ## The two-sided characterization of the code distance -/

/-- The set of undetectable nontrivial operators: orthogonal to every row of `M₁` but not
an element of the row space of `M₂`.

`ker M₁ \ rowSpace M₂` is exactly the space of logical operators modulo stabilizers:
operators that are not detected and are yet not elements of the stabilizer group, so they
really do flip the logic. The `@[reducible]` marker lets instance search unfold this
definition for the `Set.toFinset` uses below. -/
@[reducible] def undetectableSet {m₁ m₂ : ℕ}
    (M₁ : Matrix (Fin m₁) (Fin n) (ZMod 2)) (M₂ : Matrix (Fin m₂) (Fin n) (ZMod 2)) : Set (Vec n) :=
  (↑(LinearMap.ker M₁.toLin') : Set (Vec n)) \ (↑M₂.rowSpace : Set (Vec n))

/-- **The code distance**: LeanQEC's `min_weight_ker_not_mem_rowspace` (the least weight of
an undetectable nontrivial operator, taking the value `n + 1` when the set is empty),
specialized to the diagonal case in which the parity-check matrix and the row space are
one and the same.

It is **literally the same** as the upstream definition, so the conclusions of this module
feed straight back into the LeanQEC distance reduction chain. For the general
two-matrix case, use `min_weight_ker_not_mem_rowspace` directly. -/

/-- **The upper-bound theorem**: if an undetectable nontrivial operator of weight `d₀`
exists, then the code distance is at most `d₀`.

This is the witness upper bound: the certificate is a concrete low-weight logical
operator, and the kernel only has to check the three assertions `E ∈ ker M₁`,
`E ∉ rowSpace M₂` and `hammingNorm E = d₀`. -/

/-- **The lower-bound theorem**: if every undetectable nontrivial operator has weight at
least `d₀`, then the code distance is at least `d₀`.

The lower-bound side admits no short certificate unless there is a structural argument,
which is why LeanQEC reduces to SAT and UNSAT; this theorem provides the common interface
at which a lower-bound result and an upper-bound witness meet. For a computable
certificate on the lower-bound side see `QECCertificates.GF2.LowerBound`. -/

/-- **The exact distance (the two sides together)**: equal lower and upper bounds give a
distance exactly equal to $d$.

This is the formal skeleton of an exact-distance assertion: the lower bound is proved in
the kernel (or reduced through SAT and LRAT) and the upper bound is supplied by a concrete
low-weight logical operator. -/
