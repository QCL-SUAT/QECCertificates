# Translation theorems between the operator-algebra layer (operator trees) and the decision layer (GF(2) symplectic representation)

The specification calls for an **operator-tree intermediate representation** of the
operator-algebra layer, in which the expressions for Pauli and logical operators are
written as trees, together with **machine-checked translation theorems** connecting it to
the GF(2) symplectic representation of the decision layer: operator algebra travels
through trees, distance and rank decisions travel through vectors, and the two
representations each serve their own purpose while meeting. This module is the first
realization of that requirement.

## The two representations

| Layer | Objects | Operation |
|---|---|---|
| operator algebra (trees) | `PauliExpr n`: a leaf is "place a single-site Pauli at position `i`", a node is multiplication | `PauliExpr.mul` |
| decision layer (vectors) | `Vec n × Vec n`: the two GF(2) vectors `(Z side, X side)` | coordinatewise addition |

The translation `toSymp` evaluates a tree into a Pauli word and then takes its symplectic
encoding; **the main theorem states that it is a multiplicative homomorphism**:

  `toSymp (mul a b) = toSymp a + toSymp b`.

The second translation theorem is the **commutation criterion**: "commuting" at the
operator layer, meaning an even number of anticommuting sites, is equivalent to the
symplectic inner product vanishing at the decision layer. This criterion is the entry
point to every structural statement about stabilizer codes.

## Why both layers are needed

* The tree layer stays close to **expressions**: logical operators, stabilizer generators
  and intermediate circuit results are naturally expressions, and rewriting on trees,
  collecting like terms and cancelling `P·P = 1`, does not require expanding into
  $2^n$-dimensional vectors.
* The vector layer stays close to **decision**: commutation, rank and distance are all
  linear algebra over GF(2), and the vector layer can call the whole
  `QECCertificates.GF2` machinery directly.

## Main results

* `Pauli.symp_mul`: single-site multiplication corresponds to addition of symplectic
  encodings.
* `Pauli.anti_eq_symp`: the single-site anticommutation indicator equals the single-site
  symplectic inner product.
* `toSymp_mul` / `toSymp_one`: **the translation is a multiplicative homomorphism**.
* `commutesWord_iff_symplectic` / `commutes_iff_symplectic`: **the commutation criterion,
  in word form and in tree form**.

/-- **The single-site anticommutation indicator**: 1, meaning anticommute, when neither
factor is the identity and the two differ, and 0, meaning commute, otherwise.

It is given directly by the physical definition, since $X,Y,Z$ anticommute pairwise,
without recourse to the symplectic encoding; `anti_eq_symp` below is the machine-checked
result that it agrees with the symplectic inner product. -/

multiplication, and there is an explicit unit.

This is the operator-tree intermediate representation of the operator-algebra layer
called for by the specification: rewriting on trees, collecting and cancelling
$P\cdot P = 1$, does not require expanding into $2^n$-dimensional vectors. -/

This is the content of "the two representations meet": the structural operation of the
tree layer, namely multiplication, is linear at the decision layer, so an expression on
trees can be translated as a whole to the vector layer and handed to the linear algebra
machinery of `QECCertificates.GF2`. -/

if and only if the symplectic inner product vanishes at the decision layer.

This is the main public criterion of this module: every structural statement about
stabilizer codes, whether an element lies in the stabilizer group, whether a logical
operator commutes with the stabilizers, or whether a distance candidate commutes with the
checks, reduces to it. -/
